## Improvement on Annotation
- Pleae note that we received external help (Darya's brother) to correct annotation from one bad annotator.
- This improved the interannotator agreement: ask Darya for more information????????? 
- The corpus is also updated to reflect this change.
- src/data/final_corpus.csv is the corpus built in Milestone 3 which includes annotation from one bad annotator.
- src/data/final_corpus2.csv is the updated corpus with annotation from Darya's brother.
- Milestone 4 uses src/data/final_corpus2.csv.
