Our understanding of the project is that a) we collect the original English sentences (written by ESL learners) and the correct English sentences and the corresponding grammar error tags (following ERRANT format) and put into one collection. Is this correct understanding of our contribution? (is classifying the error without providing additional corrections enough of a contribution?)\n",
