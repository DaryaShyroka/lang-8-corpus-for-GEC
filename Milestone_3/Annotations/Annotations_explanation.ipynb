    "- Our scaraped corpus contains sentences from lang-8 site. The mentor mentioned that a similar study has been done in 2019 and he would like to know the percentage of overlapped sentences between 2019 study and our corpus. Therefore, our team decided to annotate sentences which do not belong to the previous study.Hence, we generated 'unannotated_sents.csv'.\n",

The column, 'agree' contains 'yes' or 'no': 'yes' if the annotators agree with the corrected sentence; 'no' if the annotators disagree with the corrected sentence. The column 'total_agree' contains the number of agreements from the annotators. Since each task is assigned to three annotators, the maximum total agreement is 3 and the minimum total agreement is 0. Note that 'agree' is set to 1 if and only if the total agreement is equal to or greater than 2. \n",
