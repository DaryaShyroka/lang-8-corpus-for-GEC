## Improvement on Annotation
- Pleae note that we received external help (Darya's brother) to correct annotation from one bad annotator.
- This improved the interannotator agreement from 10% to 13%
- The corpus is also updated to reflect this change.
- src/data/final_corpus.csv is the corpus built in Milestone 3 which includes annotation from one bad annotator.
- src/data/final_corpus2.csv is the updated corpus with the improved annotation.
- Milestone 4 uses src/data/final_corpus2.csv.

## Other mentions:
- We also compared our corpus with the 2019 lang8 corpus. There are 2903 sentences in our corpus which also appears in the previous version. Please check `/src/lang-8_corpus_comp.ipynb` to see how we compared both corpus .
- We also run our corpus through Errant to check the grammar error types on each sentence. Please check the `/src/data/lang8_errant.txt`.
